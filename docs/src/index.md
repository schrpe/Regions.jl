# Regions.jl

Region.jl defines a set of types that model a discrete 2-dimensional region concept.

In order to use the types and functions defined in the Regions package, you must first install it with the package manager and then make it known to your module:

```jldoctest reg
julia> using Regions
```

## Introduction

A region can be seen as a set of discrete coordinates in the cartesian plane. In fact, the main motivation for the region concept was to model a set of pixel locations for image processing purposes.

A region is respresented with a sorted list of horizontal runs. Runs themselves are represented with a horizontal range and a vertical coordinate.

![Region and runs](region_and_runs.svg)

Here is how this region can be created using the Julia REPL (assuming the origin (0, 0) is at the upper left):

```jldoctest reg
julia> Region([Run(0, 1:4), Run(1, 0:5), Run(2, 1:2), Run(2, 4:6), Run(3, 1:2), Run(3, 5:5), Run(4, 1:2), Run(4, 4:5), Run(5, 2:4)])
Region(Run[Run(0, 1:4), Run(1, 0:5), Run(2, 1:2), Run(2, 4:6), Run(3, 1:2), Run(3, 5:5), Run(4, 1:2), Run(4, 4:5), Run(5, 2:4)], false)
```

A run combines a vertical coordinate with a range of horizontal coordinates.


### Range

The most basic building block of a region is a range. The `UnitRange{Int64}` is a suitable type and can be written like this:

```jldoctest reg
julia> 0:99
0:99

julia> (0:99).start
0

julia> (0:99).stop
99

julia> length(0:99)
100
```

The natural sort order of ranges is to sort them by their start:

```jldoctest reg
julia> 0:100 < 1:2
true
```

### Run


### Region

A region is a subset of the discrete two-dimensional space. It represents a set (in the sense of mathematical set theory) of discrete coordinates. A region may be finite or infinite. A region may not be connected and it may contain holes.

Regions are an essential concept in computer vision and are useful in many respects.

Regions are not necessarily related to images; they can exist independently and without images. In addition, the coordinate space is not confined to the bounds of an image, and regions can extend into the quadrants with negative coordinates in the two-dimensional space.
